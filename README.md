> Emerald is a scripting language made by @AModernAnimator and @Sushi-byte-glitch, desgigned to work in **web development**, **data management**, and **applications**
> It comes in 3 versions : Basic, Dull, and Shine, each fairly different, more complex, and more efficient as they go.

Emerald is mainly inspired by Python and its readability, while it takes things from JavaScript as well.
